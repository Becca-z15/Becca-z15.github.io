In the process of creating my web portfolio, there are several difficulties.
First, there must be a very clear idea. In this way, the structure of the web page can be clearly conceived, so there is no mess when writing.
Secondly, in the process of writing code, it is necessary to know at any time what step you are taking and to adjust when you feel something is wrong. And know how to use validators, search and other tools to find and solve problems.
It is essential to check after writing all the code. After writing the code for a long time, I may lose sight of it, and it is easy to go into the wrong area. I have adjusted many errors through the modification of the validator.

By creating the web portfolio, my understanding of HTML and CSS is clearer. I am not only more proficient at using some concepts, but I can solve problems by myself quickly. With continuous practice, I feel that I have made great progress than before. I hope to have the same effect in the next semester of study.

The pictures used in the website are all taken by myself, and the logo is also designed by myself. The framework of the website comes from my past works. I have made many integrations and adjustments to the original parts to make my thinking clearer. In addition, some of the assets and resources I use come from: google fonts, google map and some free icon websites.
